# TaxiML-Predictor
This project is a machine learning application that predicts taxi fares using variables such as trip distance, weather conditions, traffic density, and other factors. The model, developed in Python, runs on a web-based interface powered by the FastAPI framework, providing real-time fare predictions based on user input.
